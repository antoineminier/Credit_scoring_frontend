##  Project description

This repository contains the frontend part files of a machine learning web application which predicts the probabiliy for a client to repay a loan. The application also provides descriptive information to compare the client's data with those of the other loan applicants. The backend part is developped using FastAPI, and the frontend part, using Streamlit.

This project of credit scoring web application is the seventh of the OpenClassrooms Data Scientist course. 

The data used are those of the [Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle's competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data).
